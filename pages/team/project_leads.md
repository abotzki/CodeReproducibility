Code Reproducibility (CodeRep) was initiated in 2022, as a part of ELIXIR Converge Training and Capacity Building project. It is organised and maintained by Alexia Cardona (ELIXIR United Kingdom) and Nazeefa Fatima (ELIXIR Norway). CodeRep Training is an open community project where everyone is welcome to contribute.
