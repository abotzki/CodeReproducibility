# Code Reproducibility
## Training on sustainable code development
The project Code Reproducibility was launched in 2022 and aims to:
- equip learners with core skills and best practices required to develop sustainable code and good software development practices.
- build collaborations with existing communities/groups that promote software development best practices and reproducibility.
- create a community of reproducibility training experts that will enable us to create, maintain and teach the reproducibility training programme developed.

The repository is for the website development of the Code Reproducibility.
